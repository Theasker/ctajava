The quick brown fowx jumps over the lazy dog.
Which is a shame, since the dog was just tired.
The fox should have taken the time to wake the dog,
and asked him to tea!

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
